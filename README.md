# Reduction-of-EV-Charging-Cost-Through-Optimal-Scheduling

# Overview
This project aims to reduce the cost of charging electric vehicles (EVs) by developing and implementing an optimal scheduling algorithm. The algorithm utilizes short-term load forecasting and Monte Carlo simulations to predict load demand and power output of photovoltaic (PV) cells. By integrating these predictions, the algorithm schedules EV charging to minimize costs and reduce the burden on the electric grid.
